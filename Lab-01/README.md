# Practice #1

In this practice it is desired to implement a system that blinks a couple of LEDs according to an 
input that is presented in the form of a pushbutton. The system will have two used LEDs as the 
output of the system and a button as input of it.

The first of the LEDs (LED #2) should flash at a frequency of 1 Hz (0.25 seconds off and 0.75 
seconds on). The second of the LEDs (LED #3) should flash at a frequency of 0.125Hz (4 seconds 
off and 4 seconds on) when the button is not pressed, and at a 1 Hz frequency (0.25 second off
and 0.75 second on) when pressed.
